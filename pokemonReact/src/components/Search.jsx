/**
 * REFACTORED: Search Component
 * 
 * CHANGES MADE:
 * 1. Removed local state (searchTerm, sortBy)
 * 2. Made this a fully "controlled component"
 * 3. Parent (App.jsx) now owns the state
 * 
 * WHY THIS IS BETTER:
 * - Single Source of Truth: State lives in one place (App.jsx)
 * - No State Duplication: Was maintaining state here AND in parent
 * - Simpler Logic: Just calls callbacks, doesn't manage state
 * - Easier Debugging: All state is in App, not scattered
 * 
 * CONTROLLED COMPONENT PATTERN:
 * A controlled component doesn't manage its own state.
 * It receives current values as props and calls callbacks to request changes.
 * This is the React-recommended pattern for forms.
 * 
 * BEFORE: Search had its own state + notified parent (2 sources of truth)
 * AFTER: Search just displays what parent tells it (1 source of truth)
